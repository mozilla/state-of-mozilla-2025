          Mozilla Foundation is our charitable arm and the “parent” to all
          Mozilla entities, a non-profit building a better technology future,
          powered by people, open by design, fueled by imagination. In 2025,
          MoFo -
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
          <li>
            Launched a new brand and website, bringing Mozilla Foundation’s
            identity into sharper focus. The redesign, by Pentagram, reflects a
            spirit of defiant optimism, and the belief that humanity is central
            to technology, and tech can be great if we keep building it with
            care.
          </li>
          <li>
            Founded the Mozilla Data Collective (MDC), a new platform for
            responsible AI data exchange. It’s the first social enterprise
            incubated by Mozilla Foundation, pioneering a radical alternative to
            how AI data is created and shared. MDC is built on the Mozilla
            Foundation’s Common Voice project, which to date has unlocked open
            datasets in 358 languages, representing 90% of the planet's
            speakers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scaled “Prototype to Program” through Creative Futures, helping
            artists, technologists, and activists turn imaginative prototypes
            into sustained programs for internet health. The initiative brought
            together new fellows and host organizations across 27 countries,
            supporting experimental ideas that use creativity to shape
            technology’s next chapter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Launched Nothing Personal, a counterculture magazine and editorial
            platform for independent thinkers, technologists, and creatives on
            the front lines of digital culture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mobilized an unprecedented wave of grassroots giving, welcoming over
            32,000 new donors from around the world in 2025. With more than
            one-third of support coming from first-time contributors, this surge
            reflects growing global belief in Mozilla’s vision for an internet
            that truly serves the public interest.

            Launched Firefox AI Window, a suite of privacy-first AI powered

            brings trusted, transparent AI tools directly into the browser.
            Users are in full control, and can shut the features off at any

          <li>
            Introduced Shake to Summarize, one of Fast Company’s “Innovations of

            to the heart of an article in seconds, with summaries adapting to
            what users are reading.
          </li>
          <li>
            Created a new model for responsible advertising, introducing a new
            advertising partnership that aligns commercial success with user
            respect, giving advertisers new ways to show up responsibly in
            environments people actually trust.
          </li>
          <li>
            A redesigned Firefox website and product updates — from smarter tab

            have made a lot of progress with bringing these services to market

          <li>
            Released Thunderbird for Android, which moved Thunderbird past the

            community, we focused on improving its functionality and user
            experience and also broke ground with development on iOS. These

          Mozilla.ai is an independent startup founded by Mozilla to build
          open-source AI infrastructure grounded in choice, agency, and trust.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, Mozilla.ai expanded its role in Mozilla’s AI ecosystem by
          strengthening the choice-first open-source stack and accelerating the
          shift toward trustworthy, interoperable AI infrastructure. We released
          new Apache-licensed libraries (any-llm, any-agent, any-guardrails, and
          mcpd), revived llamafile, and introduced encoderfile, extending
          Mozilla’s footprint down to runtime, model packaging, and local
          inference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside this open-source foundation, we launched two product-facing
          initiatives:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
          <li>
            the any-llm platform, giving technical teams a single interface to
            run workflows on any model, open or closed, with full flexibility;
          </li>
          <li>
            the Agent Platform, now in alpha with a Q1 2026 public beta program
            underway, designed for non-technical operators to safely build and
            adapt AI workflows inside their organizations.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, these efforts position Mozilla.ai as a provider of modular,
          sovereign, and user-controlled AI infrastructure, helping individuals,
          teams, and institutions adopt AI on their own terms, consistent with
          Mozilla’s mission of openness, agency, and practical empowerment.
