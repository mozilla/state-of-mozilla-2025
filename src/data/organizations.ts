    paragraph1: `Growing and investing in Firefox remains our biggest priority. Mozilla Corporation’s leading aim is to grow as a meaningful, differentiated browser, trusted by over 200mil people. In 2025 the team made great progress shipping tab groups, vertical tabs, smart tabs, many sidebar integrations with AI companies and more. Mozilla Corp welcomed Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, the first technologist to serve as CEO in over 15 years.  In 2026 there will be a focus on building tools and features for those who want AI, and for those who do not. We are the only browser who does this - and likely the only one that will.`,

      `Released over <strong>a dozen major Firefox releases</strong> including major and minor patches and improvements.`,
      `Addressed user requests for new features like <strong>vertical tabs, native tab groups and an enhanced address bar</strong>, making it easy to stack and organize tabs, even if you have hundreds of tabs open.`,
      `While other browsers are steadily killing ad-blocking plugins and features, we listened to our community and made them better, while keeping them up and running seamlessly. Firefox improved  privacy and security through features like <strong>advanced fingerprinting protections and manifest V3 Support</strong>. At the same time, announced that we would not phase out Manifest V2 in order to ensure ad-blockers continue to work, unlike in Chromium-based browsers.`,
      `Experimented with <strong>AI features with a focus on utility, user control and choice</strong>, including smarter tab groups, an AI sidebar that gives users a choice of both open and closed AI models and a ‘local first’ shake to summarize feature on iOS.`,
      `Shipping new features globally requires an ad model to subsidize those who can’t pay prices set by wealthy Silicon Valley standards. But we won’t ship advertising that surveils users and violates privacy. So we pioneered a <strong>new model for responsible advertising</strong>, launching a program that protects users from extractive advertising models and ensures privacy and respect, while offering advertisers new ways to show up responsibly in places people actually trust.`,
